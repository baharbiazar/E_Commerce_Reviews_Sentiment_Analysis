173,868,51,Great for summer,"Love this cream sleeveless top....it goes with everything and you can dress it up or down! this will be a go to top all summer long and probably wear thru the fall as well with a layered sweater, if needed. i typically wear small or medium size and got the medium hoping for a little longer length. i am 5'7, 34c, and overall wt. of approx. 128 lbs...it fits very nicely . thank you retailer!",4,1,0,General Petite,Tops,Knits
270,868,61,Nice color,I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.,3,1,0,General,Tops,Knits

277,868,83,Sooooooooo cute!,"Love this top!
it is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly.
i have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments.
love both colors, and having fun wearing them.
and after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic.
runs true to size and in the arms slightly tight, so i went with my usual med and fits perfect.
if you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size, otherwise very true to size",5,1,1,General,Tops,Knits
278,868,35,Peplum hem tee,"The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge, it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price.",3,1,2,General,Tops,Knits
282,868,65,,"This shirt is one of my favorite retailer purchases ever! it is well made and is perfect for work or the weekend. the first time i wore it, i received so many compliments!",5,1,4,General,Tops,Knits
284,868,69,Clever white edges,"I liked this top even though it was a definite 'swing' style. i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness.
looks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look. very soft and comfortable fabric. wish it was just a little bit longer.",4,1,0,General,Tops,Knits
286,868,42,,"Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference, i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs, it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight, not trying to look pregnant!",2,0,1,General,Tops,Knits

1091,868,29,I wanted to love this shirt.,"I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore, i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.",3,0,0,General,Tops,Knits
1093,868,56,Super cute with right body style,Top is very wide and flowy. i am petite with large chest so it hung from widest point and was not flattering. would be very cute with the right body shape.,3,1,3,General,Tops,Knits
1212,868,34,Nice simple staple,"I purchased this in the mauve color. beautiful color with tan skin for the summer, but also perfect for fall. the material is very thin but not sheer at all. has quite a bit of drape/swing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough. it fits me like it fits the model shown here. i am about 5'4"" 115lbs and 32b and am keeping the small.",5,1,2,General,Tops,Knits
1223,868,43,Wide,"I'm 5""0"" and weigh 105 lbs. i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide, and big all over. it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model. also, not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long. this would work better on a taller person. i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big. the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute.",2,0,7,General,Tops,Knits
1226,868,59,So cute!,"I always look for things to hide ""parts"" without making my ""parts"" look even more pronounced. this top is much cuter in person than online. it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didn't notice. the length is perfect, the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin (even though it has stripes!). perfect spring summer top.",5,1,16,General,Tops,Knits

1299,868,42,Comfy and lovely,"This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!",5,1,4,General Petite,Tops,Knits
1309,868,41,Adorable!,"This is such an adorable tee. the stripes and lace up details are super cute and on trend. i usually take a xxs and that is what i took in this tee. i tried the xs and at 5""1 and 104 pounds it looked a bit loose and long on me. love this tee and highly recommend this one!",5,1,7,General Petite,Tops,Knits
1812,868,38,Great top!,I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!,5,1,0,General,Tops,Knits

2748,868,36,Not good,"I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm, no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b, weigh 110 pounds, 5'3"" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!",2,0,5,General,Tops,Knits
2751,868,33,Doesn't wash well :(,"I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once, according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry, it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.",1,0,3,General,Tops,Knits
2767,868,44,Great top if you get the right size!!,"This top is so soft, simple, and such a closet staple, if you get the right size! for reference, i am 5'3, 128 lbs, and i ordered the petite medium. it's perfect. the black is a great color, hard to describe, kind of soft with some warm blush tones. i also ordered the white and the peach. great at the sale price!!",5,1,0,General,Tops,Knits

2770,868,43,Cute and swingy,"This top runs large. i had no problem sizing down one size, and could have gone down two sizes if not for the bust area. i ordered this tee in the distressed black color (in real life, it's more like distressed charcoal gray), and really like the fit. the asymmetric peplum is unusual, and cut at a flattering angle. i also really like that this top is not short; i often have trouble with length at retailer, being long in the torso. even going down a size, the length is great. overall, i like that t",5,1,6,General,Tops,Knits

2773,868,33,I really like it,"This top looks great with a long straight skirt (the grey with a black skirt....) and skinny jeans. i can understand why the style might not work for everyone but for me it's a perfect blend of elegant and funky. i'm sometimes a medium sometimes a large and the medium work well for me, so if in doubt size down",4,1,2,General,Tops,Knits
2776,868,42,Love it!!,"I tried this (black motif) on yesterday in my local retailer store and fell in love...after sizing down! i do have to agree with previous reviewers that this top runs large. i am typically a s, but sized down to xs, and the fit was not even slightly snug. the material is soft and comfortable and i love the asymmetrical draped ""skirted"" bottom..very funky and arty-looking. i am 5'5"" and the regular length was great on me. as much as i will enjoy wearing it all summer, i also can't wait to layer it",5,1,3,General,Tops,Knits
2777,868,29,Bulky!,"I wanted to like this top, as i usually adore a cute peplum feature. when i tried it on yesterday in the store, i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it. i am petite (5'2"", 110 lbs), and i tried my usual xs. the fabric was substantial and of a high quality, but unfortunately in this design, that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me. it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing.",3,0,1,General,Tops,Knits

2781,868,25,No!!,"I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style, but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded, and the trim of the shirt curl over, so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.",2,0,0,General,Tops,Knits

2788,868,37,Unique but runs big,"This is a super cute style and i love it with white skinnies. i purchased the gray colorway. i am normally a small in tops but purchased the xs based on other reviews. the xs is still pretty loose on me, but i don't mind too much because i like flowy tops anyway. the color is so pretty and the design is edgy. it will transition to fall well.",5,1,1,General,Tops,Knits
2789,868,25,So comfy and versatile!,"I now have this tee in 3 colors - partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me. i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose, but needed a small in this shirt. goes great with all styles of jeans/knakis.",5,1,0,General,Tops,Knits
2794,868,36,Like it so much i ordered a second one!,"I ordered this in the peach color way. it is a nice, thicker cotton and while i have only worn & washed once (i air dried) it feels like a fabric that will hold up well. fit is good, i stuck with my usual medium. at first i thought it was a little big but i didn't want to risk the arms being too tight or short by going down to a small. in the body a small would have worked i am sure, so if you have slender arms going down a size may work well. i liked it so much though i ordered a second one in",5,1,0,General,Tops,Knits

2803,868,34,So tent-like and unflattering!,"Looks great on the model, but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn't matter which size, they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in, but there's too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns, and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a",1,0,0,General,Tops,Knits

21852,868,42,Perfect warm weather tank with a twist,"This is a great light weight tank. true to size, but size up if you prefer a baggier fit, size down for a closer fit. your preference for fit should be your guide. (i prefer a closer fit, so i choose a xs, i am a 6-8 in tops) the arm holes are slim and high so you are completely covered in all sizes. excellent drape, the twist in the front is just perfect! looks great with jeans, print joggers, and even wide leg pants. i imagine it would be fantastic with a pencil skirt - denim perhaps. hope it",5,1,11,General,Tops,Knits
21874,868,65,So soft,"The fabric on this top is just so soft. it's a thin cotton knit, and drapes beautifully.

the top runs tts, but.....it is tailored to the body. it's not loose and wide in the width. the length hits the top of the hips just as shown.

this works for casual or dress. for dress, i just put a fancy rhinestone pin over where the knot is. btw, i bought this in black, which is why adding the pin glams it up. although i bought it in black, it's not sheer so a cami isn't needed.",5,1,1,General,Tops,Knits
22390,868,18,"A little big, but so comfortable!","This shirt is incredibly comfortable. the material is so soft, and it fits so well. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs with a 32b chest and i purchased a small - it is large on me, and i would have preferred an xs, but the small is just fine as well! it is a great shirt, especially for an oversized henley. 100% recommend.

22399,868,37,Comfy boxy fit,Very much liked this shirt for super casual days. its got a very flowy and boxy fit to it with side slits. it runs a bit big compared to what it looks like on the model.,4,1,0,General,Tops,Knits

22404,868,56,"Cute top, better for fall than summer","This top is sooo cute. it does not look like pajamas as one person said, it looks like a top. it's a bit on the boxy style, so anything you want to hide below is well covered. has a nice length to it. is not just for lounging. paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great. i ordered the xl (i am a 40d for reference) and it hung very nicely. its extremely soft and very comfy. i only wish they had more colors.",5,1,0,General,Tops,Knits
22409,868,51,I love this!,"I actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems. i am little (5'1"" and 103) and i don't think it's too boxy at all. i like the way it hangs. and i'll say i like it much more in person than on the model. it's somehow cozier than it looks in the picture. it's a real boosh (that mean's comfy.) i wouldn't have picked it from the online pic, but in person, it really caught my eye.",5,1,9,General,Tops,Knits
22410,868,62,,"I was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks. unfortunately, i was very disappointed when i received it. it is, as a previous person said, very much like a pajama top. it is very loose and boxy, and in my opinion, did not flatter my shape at all. sadly, i will be returning it. i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic, or straight and slender, as you suggest.",3,0,3,General,Tops,Knits
22413,868,33,"Cute, unique top","I purchased this in the store. i thought it was cute and unique. i like most things with a raw edge. i am 5'3"", 115 lbs and purchased an xs. i have worn it a couple of times and have received several compliments. my only complaint is that when i saw the pic online, i was annoyed. the top is much wider than the photo depicts. lying flat it measures 24"" side to side at the hem and 24-25"" from shoulder to hem. why take photos that misrepresent the item? there will only be more returns. so if you li",4,1,21,General,Tops,Knits
22414,868,37,Big boxy fun!,"This top is super soft cotton, with raw edges on the sleeves and hem. i bought the green top, which is a medium, faded olive color. despite the picture, this top is shortish in the front and on the sides, which are slit. the top is also very, very boxy. it's wide across, and doesn't ""fit"" the body at all. the sleeves are a slimmer fit, which contrasts nicely with the wide body. the picture is very deceptive. that said, this top is perfect for early fall/ late summer. super comfy. floaty. i wear",5,1,0,General,Tops,Knits

22425,868,38,Cute top with some caveats,"I purchased the green online, in my usual medium. i do like it but i will be returning it for a few reasons. first, i couldn't justify the price as it's really not unique enough. it kind of reminds me of a pajama top. also, i thought it was 3/4 sleeve, which it is not, it's long sleeve. and lastly, it appears to be regular length on the model. i'm maybe 5'4 at best and it's shorter and boxy. i gave it 4 stars because i really like it for what it is, but just not what i expected. it is cute, spor",4,1,21,General,Tops,Knits
22430,868,44,Cute top but looks like a tent (i'm not kidding),"I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less), i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother's day promotion on all items. based on the model's photos, the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered, i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs",1,0,21,General,Tops,Knits

22438,868,53,This one's a keeper,"Really cute top(especially the back)!  i've tried on several of these tops that overlap in the back and none of them lay as nice as this one.  the soft cotton fabric really works well with this style.  runs tts and i love that the arms are more fitted with some stretch to the fabric.  regular length works fine on my petite frame as well.  the color is a darker cream and almost has a slight nubby effect to it.  first one i received had a snag/hole in the lower sleeve, so hopefully it holds up.",5,1,0,General,Tops,Knits
22441,868,44,Versatile top,"Bought in the store, will look great with black or dark blue jeans and a fun long necklace.  does not fit like it looks on the model, it is more fitted.  i plan on wearing a spaghetti strapped cami underneath because the back has a draping effect and is open.  the front is on the shorter side but the bottom of the shirt (not including tassels) reaches the top of my jeans, and the tassels hang below.  it is a very versatile top, one that can be dressed up or down.  sleeves above wrist.",5,1,0,General,Tops,Knits

22449,868,67,Don't put it in the dryer,I loved this sweater when i bought it. wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag. it shrunk at least two sizes! and the tassels got all tangled (which i guess i should have seen coming). pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on.,3,1,0,General,Tops,Knits

23026,868,53,Might want to size down,"I just got this in the mail today. it's really cute when i put it on, but it's definitely meant to be worn slightly off the shoulders like the model is showing. i was hoping i could wear it both ways, but then the v-neck becomes way too low. i would recommend sizing down unless you're bigger busted. however, the torso is cut very true to size which might make it hard for some to size down without it becoming too small. a larger bust might help to keep this from falling off the shoulders. i'm not",4,1,33,General,Tops,Knits
