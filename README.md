# Sentiment Analysis on Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews

The goal of this project is to use NLP and machine learning models to:
<br>1- Discover the hidden topics in the reviews
<br>2- Predict the rating of clothing items based on the review wording of the customers

## Data

This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers from Kaggle. Because this is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the company in the review text and body have been replaced with “retailer”.

**Clothing ID**: Integer Categorical variable that refers to the specific piece being reviewed.
