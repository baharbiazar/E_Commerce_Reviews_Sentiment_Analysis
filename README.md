# Sentiment Analysis on Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews

## About Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is detecting whether a text has a positive or negative connotation.
This can help companies understand what is working and what is not based on the customer feedbacks.
Positive reviews show what people like.
Negative reviews identify the issues and can help change directions and improve the product or service.

## Data

This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers from Kaggle. This dataset includes 23486 rows and 10 feature variables. Each row corresponds to a customer review and there are 1206 total items that are reviewd by customers.

## Goal of the project
The goal of this project is to use NLP and machine learning models to predict if the purchased clothing items recommended by the customer based on the review they leave on the retailer's website. More specifically predicting the negative comments which are the minority class, will help the sales and marketing team to detect the negative comments across all the platforms, and valuable insight can be extracted from text and help improving the products to meet customer needs and increase the sales.
On the other hand, there is a pre-trained python library called TextBlob that has built-in sentiment analysis functions and this study tries to get better results than that.
